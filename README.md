Project Api to improve my knowledge in Java Springboot.

The idea here is for a user to registrate themselves, be able to login and add books to it's profile so he/she can track their reading.

The user can add a book and mark it with 3 status "To read, reading and read". They also can set the current page so they don't lost track and mark up to 3 books as favorites.

The books will be added to the database by the superuser/admin. (I don't know any API's where I could search for books to add)
